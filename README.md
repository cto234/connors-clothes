# Connor's Clothes

This is an ecommerce platform I'm working on to display my clothes. This is purely for myself in order to develop my skills at front end development, and is not meant to be functional in terms of actually selling items. That being said, besides payment, everything is fully operational. If I could make one change to this site it would be to implement some sort of backend to make my code cleaner and to make uploading new clothes much easier. Overall, though, I'm happy with its current state.
